# Running the code
1) Install the requirements in requirements.txt file by running the command below:

   ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` <br>


1) Download Graphviz from the following link:

    https://graphviz.org/download/

    If you are using Windows, 
        You will need to add the Graphviz bin folder to your PATH environment variable so that your system can find the Graphviz executables.
        
        Here's how you can do this:
            1. Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables". Click on the "Edit the system environment variables" option that appears.

            2. In the System Properties window that appears, click on the "Environment Variables" button.

            3. In the Environment Variables window, scroll down to the "System Variables" section and find the "Path" variable. Click on the "Edit" button.

            4. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click on the "New" button and enter the path to the Graphviz bin folder. This is typically something like "C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin" (depending on your Graphviz version and installation location).
            
            5. Click "OK" on all windows to close them and save your changes.
            
            6. Once you have added the Graphviz bin folder to your PATH environment variable, restart your windows PC. The changes will be made and you should be able to run Graphviz from the command line or from within your Python code.

2) Run the project.py file
    
    ```python project.py```


3) Prior to querying, ensure that you log in and establish a connection to the database through the pop-up login window.


4) After you've logged in successfully, go ahead and use our program!
